 * Description:
 * ============
 * The present code is a modified, commented and slightly optimized version of the C++ code that
 * Nuno Hultberg posted as a comment at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrYybddqRQs&lc=Ugxf9HO_ifM6z4g8f5N4AaABAg
 * For a description of Super Six and the notation used see the Appendix of the
 * Blog post "How to Win a Game (or More) of Super Six" at https://mhoehle.github.io/blog/2023/03/13/super6.html
 * The code uses an iterative minimax (?) approach to determine the probability to win 
 * if the game stops after h rounds. 
 * Note: It is implicitly assumed that the opposite player (Player 2) uses the
 * same optimal strategy that we try to find for Player 1.
 * 
 * Details:
 * ========
 * Let P_h(i,j,k, "continue") and P_h(i,j,k, "stop") be the probability to win 
 * after h turns from an i/j/k situation if you choose to roll the dice or stop, 
 * respectively. Here, i is the number of sticks in the lid and j, k is the number
 * of sticks in the hand of player 1 and player 2, respectively. 
 * 
 * For each throw of the dice there are three situations to consider
 *  1. you roll a six (probability 1/6) 
 *  2. (if j<5) you hit a free spot (probability (5-j)/6)
 *  3. (if j>0) you hit an occupied spot (probability j/6)
 *
 * As part of the calculations one needs to know what happens if Player 1
 * looses their turn (i.e. either by hitting an occupied spot or by voluntarily deciding to stop)
 * This depends on the strategy played by Player 2. For simplicity we will assume
 * that Player 2 plays the same optimal strategy as Player 1. 
 * 
 * At each decision point, Player 1 has the choice between the actions "continue" and "stop".
 * Player 2 will choose the action, which maximizes the probability to win, i.e.
 * a^* = argmax_{a \in \{continue, stop}} P_h(i,j,k,a)
 * 
 * Several additional aspects matter though:
 * a) Say Player 1 is in a i/j/k situation. If they stop, then Player 2 will
 *    be facing an i/k/j situation. The probability that Player 2 will win
 *    is thus P_h(i,k,j, "continue") or P_h(i,k,j, "stop"), respectively.
 * b) After h rounds the game might not be finished yet. Hence, it can happend that
 *    neither of the two player wins after h rounds. In other words
 *    max(P_h(i,j,k, "continue") + P_h(i,j,k, "stop") < 1
 *  Let D_h(i,j,k, "continue") and
 *    D_h(i,j,k, "stop") be the probabilities that a game is actually finished
 *    after h rounds. 
 * 
 * player cannot decide whether to throw the dice or not (decision has to be THROW). It is unclear if this is covered by
 * the recursive computations.
