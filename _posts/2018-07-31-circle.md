## Abstract:

In 2007 Alexander Overwijk went viral with his 'Perfect Circle'
video. The same year a World Freehand Circle Drawing Championship was
organized, which he won. In this post we show how a mobile camera, R
and the imager package can be used to develop an image analysis based
method to judge future instances of the championship.

## Introduction

A few years back I watched with awe the 2007 video of
[Alexander Overwijk](https://twitter.com/AlexOverwijk)'s freehand
drawing a 1m diameter circle:

</center>
<FONT COLOR="bbbbbb">Note: Depending on your browser you might need to click "[Watch on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAhfZUZiwSE)" to see the video.</FONT>
<p>

Ever since watching that video I have wondered how one would go about to
judge the winner of such an alleged
[World Freehand Circle Drawing Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1J5ANnq0T8)
(WFHCDC). While researching for this post I finally figured it out. On
his web page Alexander in the story behind the video
["reveals"](http://slamdunkmath.blogspot.com):

*They have a laser machine called the **circleometer** that creates the
perfect circle closest to the one you drew. The circleometer then
calculates the difference in area between the laser circle and the
circle that you drew. The machine then calibrates the area difference
as if you had drawn a circle with radius one meter. The person with
the smallest area difference is declared the world freehand circle
drawing champion.*

Aha! Imaginary circleometers are expensive and my dean of study most
likely isn't open for investing in perfect circle measurement
equipment... So here is a cheaper solution involving a mobile device
camera, [R](https://www.r-project.org) and the
[`imager`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/index.html)
package by
[Simon Barthelmé](https://sites.google.com/site/simonbarthelme/) et
al. Altogether a combination of modern *data science* tools, which my dean of study is
most likely to approve!  We'll use a screenshot from the perfect
circle video as motivating example to guide through the 3 phases of
the method:

1. Image Rectification
2. Freehand circle identification and perfect circle estimation
3. Quantifying deviation from the perfect circle

We start by loading the screenshot into R using `imager`:


```r
library("imager")
file <- "circle2.png"
img <- imager::load.image(file.path(fullFigPath, file))
```
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-07-31-circle/PLOTSCREENSHOT-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Image Rectification

The image clearly suffers from perspective distortions caused by the
camera being positioned to the right of the circle and, hence, not being
orthogonal to the blackboard plane. Furthermore, small lense
distortions are also visible - for example the right vertical line of
the blackboard arcs slightly. Since the video contains no details
about what sort of lense equipment was used, for the sake of
simplicity, we will ignore lense distortions in this post. If such
information is available one can use a program such as
[RawTherapee](http://rawtherapee.com) (available under a GNU GPL v3
license) to read the EXIF information in the meta data of the image and
automatically correct for lens distortion.

To rectify the image we estimate the parameters of the 2D projection
based on 4 ground control points (GPC). We use R's `locator` function
to determine the pixel location of the four corner points of the
blackboard in the image, but could just as well use any image analysis
program such as [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org). Furthermore, we need the
true object coordinates of these GPC. Unfortunately, these are only
approximately available to due lack of knowledge of the size of the
blackboard in the classroom. As a consequence a *guesstimate* of the
horizontal length is used.


```r
plot(img)
p <- locator(4)
p <- round(cbind(p$x, p$y))
dump(list=c("p"), "")
```


These points are now used to rectify the image by a Direct Linear Transformation (DLT)
based on exactly 4 control points
[@hartley_zisserman2004, Chapter 4]^[Alternatively, see slide 18 and onward in https://ags.cs.uni-kl.de/fileadmin/inf_ags/3dcv-ws11-12/3DCV_WS11-12_lec04.pdf]. That
is the parameters of the 3x3 transformation matrix $H$ in homogeneous
coordinates are estimated
such that $p' = H p$, see the [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoehleatsu/hoehleatsu.github.io/master/_source/2018-07-31-circle.Rmd)
on github for details.


We can implement the rectifying transformation using the
`imager::warp` function:

```r
##Transform image coordinates (x',y') to (x,y), i.e. note we specify
##the back transformation p = H * p', so H here is the inverse.
map.persp.inv <- function(x,y, H) {
  out_image <- H %*% rbind(x,y,1)
  list(x=out_image[1,]/out_image[3,], y=out_image[2,]/out_image[3,])
}
##Pad dx_blackboard pixels to the right to make space for blackboard
img_padded <- pad(img, nPix=dx_blackboard, axes="x", pos=1)
##Warp image
warp <- imwarp(img_padded, map=function(x,y) map.persp.inv(x,y,solve(H)),coordinates="absolute", direction="backward")
```
The result looks as follows:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-07-31-circle/PLOTRECTIFICATION-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Please notice the different x-axes of the two images when comparing
them.  For faster computation and better visualization in the
remainder of this post, we crop the x-axis of the image to the
relevant parts of the circle.


```r
warp <- imsub(warp, x %inr% c(dx_blackboard, nrow(warp)))
```
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-07-31-circle/PLOTRECTIFIED-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Freehand circle identification

As described in the `imager`
[edge detection tutorial](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/canny.html)
we use length of the gradient to determine the edges in the
image. This can be done by applying filters to the image.


```r
##Edge detection function. Sigma is the size of the blur window.
detect.edges <- function(im, sigma=1) {
  isoblur(im,sigma) %>% imgradient("xy") %>% enorm() %>% imsplit("c") %>% add
}
#Edge detection filter sequence.
edges <- detect.edges(warp,1) %>% sqrt
```

To detect the circle from this we specify a few seed points for a
[watershed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_%28image_processing%29)
algorithm with a priority map inverse proportional to gradient magnitude. This includes a few points outside the
circle and a few points inside the circle. Note: a perfect circle
would have no border, but when drawing a circle with a piece of chalk
it's destined to have a thin border line.





<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-07-31-circle/SEGMENTATION-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
We can now extract the circle by:

```r
##Just the circle
freehandCircle <- (warp * (mask==2) > 0) %>% grayscale
##Total area covered by the circle
freehandDisc <- label(freehandCircle, high_connectivity=TRUE) > 0
```

```r
dilatedDisc <- freehandDisc %>% dilate_rect(sx=3,sy=3)
freehandCircleThinBorder <- (freehandDisc - dilatedDisc) != 0
```
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-07-31-circle/PLOTTHINBORDER-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Perfect circle estimation

Once the freehand circle path in the image has been identified, we need
to find the best fitting *perfect* circle matching this path. This problem is
elegantly solved by @coope1993, who formulates the problem as finding
center and radius of the circle minimizing the squared
Euclidean distance to $m$ data points $a_j$, $j=1,\ldots,m$.
Denoting by $c$ the center of the circle and by $r>0$ the radius we
want to find the solution of

$$
\min_{c\in \mathbb{R^2}, r>0} \sum_{j=1}^m F_j(c,r)^2, \quad\text{where}\quad F_j(c,r) = \left|r - ||c-a_j||_2\right|,
$$

and $||x||_2$ denotes Euclidean distance. Because the curve fitting
minimizes the distance between an observed point $a_j$ and the closest
point on the circle and thus involves both the $x$ and the $y$
direction , this is a so called
**[total least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_least_squares)**
problem. The problem is non-linear and can only be solved by iterative
numerical methods. However, the dimension of the parameter space can
be reduced by one, because given the center $c$ we can determine that
$r(c)=\frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m ||c-a_j||_2$.



```r
##Compute radius given center
radius_given_center <- function(center, dist=NULL) {
  if (is.null(dist)) {
    a <- as.matrix(where(freehandCircleThinBorder > 0))
    dist <- sqrt((a[,1] - center[1])^2 + (a[,2] - center[2])^2)
  }
  return(mean(dist))
}

##Target functin of the total least squares criterion of Coope (1993)
target_tls <- function(theta) {
  ##Extract parameters
  center <- exp(theta[1:2])

  ##Total least squares criterion from Coope (1993)
  a <- as.matrix(where(freehandCircleThinBorder > 0))
  dist <- sqrt((a[,1] - center[1])^2 + (a[,2] - center[2])^2)
  ##Compute radius given center
  radius <- radius_given_center(center, dist)

  F <- abs( radius - dist)
  sum(F^2)
}


res_tls <- optim(par=log(c(x=background[1,1], y=background[1,2])), fn=target_tls)
center <- exp(res_tls$par)
fit_tls <- c(center,radius=radius_given_center(center))
fit_tls
```

```
##        x        y   radius 
## 894.3885 707.3191 518.4119
```

We illustrate the freehand circle (in black) and the fitted circle
(magenta) on top of each other using the alpha channel. You have to
study the image carefully to detect differences between the two curves!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-07-31-circle/DRAWCIRCLE-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Quantifying the circularness of the freehand circle

We quantify the **circularness** of the freehand circle by contrasting
the area covered by it with the area of the fitted perfect circle. The
closer this ratio is to 1 the more perfect is the freehand circle.


```r
##Area of the freehand drawn disc
areaFreehandDisc <- sum(freehandDisc)

##Area of the disc corresponding to the idealized circle fitted
##to the freehand circle
areaIdealDisc <- pi * fit_tls["radius"]^2

##Ratio between the two areas
ratio_area <- as.numeric(areaFreehandDisc  / areaIdealDisc)
ratio_area
```

```
## [1] 0.9971778
```

Yup, it's a pretty perfect circle! Note also that the calibration is
to a circle with an area of 1 pixel unit and not a circle with
diameter of 1m as described in the above text about the
"circleometer". Since the fitted circle already takes the desired
shape into account, my intuition is that this ratio is a pretty good
way to quantify circularness. However, to and avoid **measurehacks**,
we use as backup measure the circleometer approach: for each
point on the freehand circle we measure its distance to the freehand
circle and integrate/sum this up over the path of the freehand
circle. We can approximate this integration approach using image
pixels as follows.


```r
##Create a pixel based circle in an image of the same size as the
##freehandCircle img. For visibility we use a border of 'border' pixels
##s.t. circle goes [radius - border/2, radius + border/2].
Circle <- function(center, radius, border) {
  as.cimg(function(x,y) {
    lhs <- (x-center[1])^2 + (y-center[2])^2
    return( (lhs >= (radius-border/2)^2) & (lhs <= (radius+border/2)^2))
  }, dim=dim(freehandCircle))
}

##Build pixel circle based on the fitted parameters
C_tls <- Circle(fit_tls[1:2], fit_tls[3], border=1)
##Calculate Euclidean distance to circle for each pixel in the image
dist <- distance_transform(C_tls, value=1, metric=2)
##Distance between outer border of freehand circle and perfect circle
area_difference <- sum(dist[freehandCircleThinBorder>0])

##Compute area difference and scaled it by the area of the fitted disc
ratio_areadifference <- as.numeric(area_difference / areaIdealDisc)
```

The image below illustrates this by overlaying the result on top of
the distance map. For better visualization we zoom in on the 270-300
degree part of the circle (i.e. the bottom right). In magenta is the
fitted perfect circle, in gray the freehand circle and the area
between the two paths is summed up over the entire path of the
freehand circle:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/figure/source/2018-07-31-circle/PLOTAREADIFF-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We obtain `ratio_areadifference`= 0.01735.  Thus also this measure tells
us: it's a pretty perfect circle! To summarise: The output on the
display of the official's Circle-O-Meter App (available under a GPL v3
license) at the World Freehand Circle Drawing Championship would be as
follows: 😉

## Discussion

We took elements of computer vision, image analysis and total least
squares to segment a chalk-drawn circle on a blackboard and provided
measures of it's circularness. Since we do not have direct access to
the measurements of the blackboard a little guesstimation was
necessary, nevertheless, results show that it was a pretty circular
freehand circle!

With the machinery in place for judging freehand circles, its time to
send out the call for contributions to the **2nd World Freehand Circle
Drawing Championship** (online edition!). Stay tuned for the call:
participants would upload their photo plus minor modifications of a
general analysis script to get the two area ratios measures by pull
request to a
[github project](https://github.com/hoehleatsu/worldfreehandcirclechampionship).
You can spend the anxious waiting time practicing your freehand 1m
diameter circles - it's a good way to loosen up long & unproductive
meetings!

## Appendix

If we instead of the total sum of squares criterion involving
$F_j(c,r)$ mentioned in the text solve the related criterion
$$
\sum_{j=1}^m f_j(c,r)^2, \quad\text{where}\quad f_j(c,r) =
||c-a_j||_2^2 - r^2,
$$
then a much simpler solution emerges. @coope1993 explains that
this alternative criterion  geometrically corresponds to minimizing the
product

$$
\text{(distance to the closest point on the circle)}\times \text{(distance to
the furthest away point point on the circle)}
$$

over the measurement point. In order to obtain the solution write the
residuals $f_j$ as $f_j(c,r) = c^T c - 2 c^T a_j +
a_j^T a_j - r^2$ and perform a change of variables from $(c_1, c_2,
r)'$ to
$$
y  =
\left[
\begin{matrix}
2 c_1 \\
2 c_2 \\
r^2 - c^T c \\
\end{matrix}
\right]
\quad \text{and let} \quad
b_j =
\left[
\begin{matrix}
a_{j1} \\
a_{j2} \\
1
\end{matrix}
\right].
$$
The minimization problem then becomes
$$
\min_{y \in \mathbb{R}^3} \sum_{j=1}^m \left\{ a_j^T a_j - b_j^T y \right\},
$$
which can be written as a linear least square (LLS) expression
$$
\min_y ||By - d||_2^2,
$$
where $B$ is a $3\times m$ matrix with the $b_j$-vectors as columns
and $d=||a_j||_2^2$. This expression is then easily solved using the standard
least squares machinery.


```r
##Fast linear least squares problem as described in Coope (1993)
fitCircle_lls <- function(freehandCircle) {
  a <- as.matrix(where(freehandCircle > 0))
  b <- cbind(a,1)
  B <- b
  d <- a[,1]^2 + a[,2]^2
  y <- solve(t(B) %*% B) %*% t(B) %*% d
  x <- 1/2*y[1:2]
  r <- as.numeric(sqrt(y[3] + t(x) %*% x))
  return(c(x=x[1], y=x[2], radius=r))
}

##Fit using linear least squares procedure of Coole (1993)
fit_lls <- fitCircle_lls(freehandCircleThinBorder)

##Compare TLS and LLS fit
rbind(lls=fit_lls,tls=fit_tls)
```

```
##            x        y   radius
## lls 894.3666 707.3901 518.4295
## tls 894.3885 707.3191 518.4119
```

In other words: the results are nearly identical.
